Problem:
We have 10 person with 2 treatments
Each person receive every treatment. 
For each person it takes 5 measures of their blood glucose per day during 50 days.
Our dependant variable is how many days the blood glucose is high (per day measure, per person and treatment)

Variables:
Progama.Alimentacion is the treatment applied with two factor: A or B
GlucemiaAlta, days with blood glucose is higher than normal levels.
glpersona, the person itself
gltoma, index of the measure in the day. gltoma =1 means is the first measure with made in the day.

R code: 
# Read the data and save it "glucemia"
glucemia<-read.table("GLUCEMIA.csv", header = T, sep=";")

#Creating factor for each of the 5 measures that the study takes per day.
gltoma<- gl(5, 1, labels=c("1","2","3","4","5") )

# Creating factor for each person that is part of the study
glpersona<- gl(10, 5, labels=c("1","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10") )

#Putting all together
glucemia<-cbind(glucemia,gltoma, glpersona)

# Resolving
To model this problem, I ve decided to use a general linear mixed model with family binomial, logit link function

Model: g(uijk)= αi + βj +  Zk * uk
αi is the fixed effect of treatment i , βj is the fixed effect of measure j  y Zi * ui, is the random effect of person j. 

Using glmer

model <-glmer(cbind(GlucemiaAlta,Total-GlucemiaAlta) ~ -1 + Programa.Alimentacion + gltoma  
                +(1 | glpersona), family = binomial, 
                data=glucemia, nAGQ=1)
