#The idea of my thesis is to text generation based on audio files. The first idea was to use midi files (now i will use mp3 files). 
#To gather midi from website, the next code was created

#We load the libraries

library(rvest)
library(httr)
library(dplyr)
library(stringi)
library(tokenizers)

#We create a vector of diferentes generes
genre=c("pop","rock","rap","dance","punk","blues","country","movie","jazz","hip-hop")


songs=c()

# We create a function where
scrape_midi=function(genre) { 
for ( p in 1:200) { 

#use the genre to build the entire website, p is page of midi of a given genre  
URL=paste0("http://www.midiworld.com/search/",p,"/?q=",genre[i])



#We read the website amd we extrac text, to avoid doing much request to the server
we=read_html(URL) %>% html_node('#page') %>% html_text()

#We extract the download link
wor=tokenize_lines(we)
wor=as.data.frame(wor[[1]]);names(wor)=c("list")

        if (grepl("found nothing!",wor$list)[2]==TRUE) { next  }
        else { 

                                          ind=grep("- download",wor$list)
                                          wor=wor[ind,]
                                          
                                          
                                          wor_=gsub("- download","",wor)
                                          songs=rbind(songs,wor_)
                                                                      
              #Then, our function download each midi file
                for (j in 1:length(wor_)) {

                  we=read_html(URL) %>% html_node(xpath =paste0( '//*[@id="page"]/ul[1]/li[',j,']/a')) %>% html_attr("href") 
                  
                  destfile <- paste0(getwd(),"/midi/",wor_[j],".mid")
                  
                  try(download.file(we, destfile,method="curl",quiet=T))
                  print(j)
                }}
a<<-j
b<<-p
}}
                  
#We repeat this formula for each genre                  
for (i in 1:length( genre)) { 
  gen=genre[i]
  scrape_midi(gen)
  print(i)
    }            
    
    
#Of course, this code can be improved and when i ve coded, i did not realize about some ideas to avoid being banned (i was not bannet but it could have happened)
